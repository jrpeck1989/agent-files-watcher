# Coding Standards for TypeScript/Node.js Projects

## General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly express intent
- Write self-documenting code with clear logic flow

## Code Structure

- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks or Result types
- Implement proper logging for debugging and monitoring
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces for TypeScript/JavaScript)

## Import/Export Standards

- Use named imports/exports over default when possible
- Group imports: built-in modules, external packages, then local modules
- Use absolute imports with path mapping when available

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex functions
- Include examples in documentation when helpful
- Keep README files current with project setup and usage instructions
