# Development Best Practices

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario being tested
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies in unit tests

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid blocking the event loop in Node.js applications
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Monitor memory usage and optimize when necessary

## Security Best Practices

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Keep dependencies updated and audit for vulnerabilities
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Code Review Standards

- Review for logic correctness, not just syntax
- Check for potential security vulnerabilities
- Ensure code follows established patterns and conventions
- Verify adequate test coverage for new features
