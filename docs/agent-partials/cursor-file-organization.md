# File and Directory Organization

## Directory Structure Standards

- Use clear, descriptive directory names
- Group related functionality together
- Separate source code, tests, and configuration
- Keep build artifacts and generated files out of source control

## File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for file names (my-component.ts)
- Use PascalCase for class files (UserService.ts)
- Include file type in name when helpful (user.model.ts, user.service.ts)
- Use consistent naming patterns across the project

## Module Organization

- Export related functionality from index files
- Keep module exports clean and well-organized
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use barrel exports judiciously to maintain tree-shaking

## Configuration Management

- Centralize configuration in dedicated files
- Use environment-specific configuration files
- Document all configuration options
- Validate configuration at startup
